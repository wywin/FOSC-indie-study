# FOSC-indie-study

So, to finish my FOSS minor at RIT, I am doing an independent study for a pre-existing course, because scheduling worked out in such a way that I can't take it normally before I graduate, and it is the last requirement to complete the minor.

I'm still not entirely sure what I'm doing, but I'll do my best regardless.
